Hide and Seek : An AI Based Game

PLEASE NOTE:
if you are launching the unity project, there will most likely be errors.
this is because the ML-Agents package is not installed.

In unity open the package manager and in the top left click the plus symbol. press add from disk
Then navigate to this github folder. click on ML-Agents API -> API -> Package

this will install the package into unity and resolve any issues.


If you just want to launch the build of the game select the folder "Prototype Builds".

Thankyou
